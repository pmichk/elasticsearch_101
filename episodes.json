The Doctor notes a similarity between Ravalox and Earth, with objects from Earth—notably Marble Arch tube station and the novel Moby Dick—present on Ravalox. The only apparent astronomical difference between the two is Ravalox's position in the galaxy. Rogue Sabalom Glitz (Tony Selby) attempts to obtain secrets and technology that are guarded by a robot. The Doctor is forced to deactivate the robot’s unstable power supply to avoid a chain reaction, but in the process the secrets are destroyed.
